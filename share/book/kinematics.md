The interaction of the shoulder joints during arm elevation is commonly assessed using the scapulo-humeral rhythm (SHR) (==Codman 1934==). This ratio describes the contribution of the glenohumeral joint (GH) to the arm elevation compared to the acromio-clavicular (AC) and sterno-clavicular joints (SC). An atypical scapulohumeral rhythm is usually associated with a musculoskeletal disorder of the shoulder, whether or not there is pain {==Robert-Lachaîne, 2014 #121==}. While the standard evaluation of the SHR is done with a goniometer, a novel technique that benefits from three-dimensional motion capture has been developed by ==Robert-Lachaine (2014)==. By iteratively resetting the joints to their reference orientation, this technique calculates the contribution of each shoulder joint to the thoraco-humeral angle {==Robert-Lachaîne, 2014 #121==}. However, as the SHR implies a ratio ($\frac{\text{GH}}{\text{SC+AC}}$), numerical instabilities can occur if the denominator approaches zero. In our experimental settings, the SC-AC contribution approximates zero in the early lifting phase (==FIG==). Such numerical instabilities make the use of the SHR ==risky== during a manual handling task involving the upper limb. By extension and more generally, the same method could be used to calculate the joint contribution to the elevation of an object rather than arm elevation. This is particulary interesting during a manual handling task as we can evaluate the amount of box height achieved by each joint. As an example, the effect of sex on the joint contributions during a lifting task has been investigated. The contribution of the upper limb joints were compared between women and men lifting a 6 kg box. On the group of joints considered, women show a greater glenohumeral contribution to box height (approximately 15% higher in women compared to men) in the last half of the movement (==FIG==). These results highlight sex-related differences in lifting strategy with a same absolute mass of 6 kg. 

Such analysis could be used to evaluate joint functions and identify poor techniques.
